# makeWebLogicSelectable
A client-side user script to make the WebLogic admin console a little more useable. This scriptlet will check to see if the admin console is not locked for editing. If so, it will enlarge fields with overflow and make every field selectable. How nice!

To install this script on Chrome, save as “makeWebLogicSelectable.user.js”. Open the extensions screen (or open chrome://extensions/) and drag the file into the browser. Alternatively, use Tampermonkey. For Firefox, use Scriptish or Greasemonkey. Install either, open Add-ons, open the newly added option and drag the JS file there.
